    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <p>When an earthquake strikes, it is extremely important to take appropriate action without panicking. This is the only sure way to minimize the damage.</p>
      <p>To achieve this, it is essential that we understand the danger of earthquakes and prepare properly in our daily lives. Knowledge and preparation will help us to act calmly when disaster strikes.</p>

      <h2>Basic points at home</h2>
      <p>Get under a stable desk or table and hold onto its legs tightly.Protect your head with a cushion or the like and stay put until the tremors stop.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If a big tremor strikes suddenly, remember to secure your own safety first.</li>
        <li>Open doors and secure exit and entry routes.</li>
        <li>Shelves and items placed on shelves (TV sets, etc.) may fall. Stay clear of shelves until the tremors stop.</li>
        <li>Try not to flee from the building in a wild panic.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When sleeping in a bedroom</h2>
      <p>If a tremor wakes you, secure your safety by getting under your bedding or bed, if possible.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Beware of broken glass from windows or light bulbs in the dark.</li>
        <li>To prepare for a sudden evacuation, keep a pair of thick socks, slippers, flashlight, and mobile radio next to your bed or futon.</li>
        <li>Never put anything that can easily fall or topple over in your bedroom. Make sure that nothing can fall on you while you asleep.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When in a bathroom</h2>
      <p>If you feel a tremor, open the door immediately to secure your exit route, then wait until the tremors stop.　</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tiles or mirrors may fall in a bathroom, or a water tank may topple from the toilet.</li>
        <li>Beware of injuries from broken mirrors or glass, if the tremors strike while you’re bathing.</li>
        <li>If in the bathtub, protect your head by covering yourself with the bathtub lid, or whatever else is available.</li>
        <li>Put on only essential clothing, (deletion) wait until the tremors stop, and evacuate.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When in the kitchen</h2>
      <p>Get under a table or the like and wait until the tremors stop.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you rush to turn off a gas flame, falling pots and pans may scald you. Wait until the tremors stop before turning off the flame.</li>
        <li>Watch out for cupboards or refrigerators. These can fall on you, or contents can fly out from them.</li>
        <li>If near cooker, move away in case pots or pans slip and fall. Wait until the tremors stop and then carefully turn off the flame.</li>
        <li>Most households are equipped with gas leakage breakers (gas micron meters) that sense tremors and stop the gas supply automatically. Be sure to understand these devices and use them properly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Condominiums</h2>
      <p>Note that tremors are more intense on the upper floors than on the ground level.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The risk of collapse is low. (delete) Get under a stable desk or the like and wait until the tremors stop.</li>
        <li>There may be a small delay before you feel the tremors on the upper floors. Once they start, however, they tend to last longer at a wider amplitude.</li>
        <li>Check the locations of the emergency exits on a regular basis.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Offices</h2>
      <p>Move away from cabinets, shelves, lockers, and copying machines in the office. Cover your head and get under a desk or the like to protect yourself.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Move away from the windows. Window glass may break during the tremor.</li>
        <li>Watch out for falling office equipment.</li>
        <li>Try to improve your working environment on a daily basis by organizing, tidying up, and so on. </li>
        <li>When evacuating the building, watch out for falling objects and never try to use an elevator.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Supermarkets・Department stores</h2>
      <p>Protect your head with a bag or shopping basket and move away from showcases or high shelves stocked with items that may fall.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Find shelter in an elevator hall, or anywhere else uncluttered with merchandize and near a supporting pillar column.</li>
        <li>Watch out for falling glassware, ceramic ware, and other items on display shelves.</li>
        <li>Do not just rush to the exit. Follow the instructions of the staff.</li>
        <li>Do not attempt to evacuate on an elevator, even if it seems to be working.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Movie theaters・Theaters</h2>
      <p>Protect your head using a bag or the like and find shelter between the seats. Stay put until the tremors stop. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Evacuate to a safe place, watching out for window glass and objects falling from above.</li>
        <li>Even if the power supply is cut off, evacuation lights or emergency lights will turn on. Follow the instructions of the theater staff without panicking..</li>
        <li>Never rush to the exits or staircases.</li>
        <li>Check the locations of the emergency exits beforehand.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Underground mall</h2>
      <p>Protect your head with a bag or the like and try not to panic. Stay put until the tremors stop. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the power supply cuts off, wait until the emergency lights turn on. Do not move without good reason.</li>
        <li>Emergency exits are located at 60m intervals in underground malls. Be calm and proceed through the exit up to the ground level. Never rush to an emergency exit congested with people. </li>
        <li>When evacuating, walk alongside the walls.</li>
        <li>You will be safe as long as there is no fire. Act calmly, without panicking.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Schools</h2>
      <p>Get under a desk to protect yourself from falling objects in the classroom. Follow the instructions of the teacher without taking sudden actions (such as fleeing the building in a panic).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In corridors, playgrounds, or gymnasiums, get together and squat in the middle of the area.</li>
        <li>In any kind of laboratory, pay attention to chemicals or fire while evacuating.</li>
        <li>The route back home may be dangerous in some cases. Do not return home without asking.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Elevators</h2>
      <p>The basic rule is to press the buttons for all floors and get off at the first floor where the elevator stops. Be sure, however, never to rush onto a floor with fire or other serious danger.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Emergency services assume that there will be many people trapped in elevators when an earthquake strikes. You may not be rescued immediately.</li>
        <li>If you are trapped in an elevator, try to remain calm without panicking. Try to make contact with someone using the Emergency Call Button, etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="divider"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
    <h2>Residential district</h2>
    <p>If a strong quake strikes, the streets of residential districts will probably be blocked off with collapsed objects. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Block or stone walls along residential streets may fall during strong quakes. If you feel an earthquake, move away from these walls.</li>
      <li>Electric poles and vending machines may also fall over, so move away from them, too.</li>
      <li>Roofing tiles, external air conditioners, and planters on verandas and upper floors may fall. Look out for objects falling from above. </li>
      <li>If a strong quake strikes, houses with low earthquake resistance may collapse, filling the road with rubble or window glass. Be vigilant of surrounding conditions if you feel a strong tremor</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Business districts・Downtown</h2>
    <p>Window glass, outer walls, and signboards may fall from high- and middle-rise buildings downtown or in business districts.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If window glass in an office building breaks and falls, it will disperse fast (at a speed of 40 ~ 60 km). Tiles on the outer walls of buildings or signboards attached to outer walls may also fall. Protect your head with your shoes or the like and move as far away from the buildings as possible.</li>
      <li>The danger of falling signboards and neon signs is greater in downtown areas than in business districts. Be especially alert if there are strong tremors. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Seaside</h2>
    <p>The biggest earthquake danger facing you at the seaside is a tidal wave (tsunami). Move to higher ground or an evacuation site immediately, without waiting for instructions or evacuation advice.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If there is no higher ground nearby, go into a building with at least four floors and take the stairs up to the 4th floor or above. </li>
      <li>Tidal waves attack in series. In some cases, the second and third wave is higher than the first. Never go back to the seaside, even if the waves recede.</li>
      <li>If there are signs pointing out evacuation routes, use them as a guide for evacuation.</li>
      <li>If an earthquake strikes while you're bathing in the sea, there may be lifeguards or lifesavers nearby. If so, they will tell you where and how to evacuate the area.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Riverside</h2>
    <p>Tidal waves travel up water-filled rivers.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you evacuate upstream along the river, the tidal wave may chase you. You need to evacuate quickly at a right angle to the flow of the river.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Mountainous・Hilly districts</h2>
    <p>Move away from dangerous areas such as steep sloping land, watching out for falling rocks as you proceed.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you are struck by a strong tremor while hiking or climbing a mountain, protect yourself from falling rocks first.</li>
      <li>The ground may loosen and become highly unstable during an earthquake. Be sure to stay away from areas with fallen rocks or steep sloping land.</li>
    </ul>

      <h1>Vehicle case</h1>
      <div class="divider"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
    <h2>While driving a car</h2>
    <p>Unforeseen accidents may result if you try to make a sudden stop.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you feel a tremor,</li>
      <li>1. Never make a sudden stop. Keep firm hold of the steering wheel and gradually slow down, paying attention to the cars in front of you and behind. Pull over to the left side of the road when it is safe to do so.</li>
      <li>2. Turn off the engine and stay in your car until the tremors stop. Get information from the car radio.</li>
      <li>3. If you need to evacuate the area, take important items, including your car registration. Leave the key in the car and a note with your contact address. Leave the doors unlocked. </li>
      <li>4. Vacate the area on foot.</li>
      <li>Do not vacate by car. This will block the passage of emergency vehicles.</li>
      <li>If driving on the highway, observe the following points in addition to the points mentioned for regular roads above.</li>
      <li>○When driving at high speed, turn on your hazard lamps to ensure that the cars ahead of you and behind you can see you.</li>
      <li>○Emergency exits are located at about 1 km intervals on highways. You can escape to the ground on foot via one of those exits.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Railways</h2>
    <p>Be prepared for an emergency stop. Stay low and keep hold of handrails or straps to avoid injury.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If a strong tremor is detected, the train will make an emergency stop.</li>
      <li>If sitting, keep low and protect your head with a bag or the like. If standing, keep hold of a handrail or strap to avoid falling over.</li>
      <li>Once the train comes to a halt, follow the instructions of the crew.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Shinkansen (Bullet Train)</h2>
    <p>The Urgent Earthquake Detection and Alarm System (UrEDAS) stops the train in the event of an emergency. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Shinkansen runs at a very high speed. If you are sitting on a seat, get down between the seats to prevent yourself being flung forward. If you are standing, keep hold of the handrail to avoid falling.</li>
      <li>Once the train comes to a halt, follow the instructions of the crew.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Subway</h2>
    <p>Subway trains will come to an emergency stop when a quake of intensity 5 lower is detected. If the train is between stations, it checks and proceeds to the nearest station at low speed.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The subway travels at a speed of about 40~50 km per hour. </li>
      <li>If sitting, keep low and protect your head with a bag or the like. If standing, keep hold of a handrail or strap to avoid falling over. </li>
      <li>Even if the power supply is cut off, emergency lights will remain on for about 1 hour. This gives you ample time to evacuate calmly. Be sure never to panic. </li>
      <li>Some subway lines have high-voltage electric wires laid at the sides of the rails. This makes it extremely dangerous to jump onto the tracks. Never attempt to do so without asking. </li>
      <li>Once the train comes to a halt, follow the instructions of the crew.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bus</h2>
    <p>The bus driver may brake suddenly. Stay low and hold of a handrail or strap to avoid injury.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the driver feels a strong quake, he will try to slow down gradually without making a sudden stop. If necessary to avoid danger, however, the driver may be forced to brake suddenly. </li>
      <li>If sitting, keep low and protect your head with a bag or the like. If standing, keep hold of a handrail or strap to avoid falling over.</li>
      <li>Once the bus comes to a halt, follow the instructions of the driver.</li>
    </ul>

      <div class="divider"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
    <h2>Securing your own safety</h2>
    <p>Check around you first. Secure your own safety.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you act in a panic, you may be injured by toppling furniture or scattered glass.</li>
      <li>When the tremors weaken or stop completely, open a window or door to secure your exit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Planning your evacuation wisely</h2>
    <p>Judge wisely, based on accurate information! Your life may depend on it.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>False information tends to circulate after a disaster strikes. Try to get your information from TV, the radio, or public offices. Don't be misled by rumors. </li>
      <li>When a public office gives any instruction or advice, follow it.</li>
      <li>In some cases no instructions or advice will be given. If you have no information but feel danger, evacuate immediately! </li>
      <li>Fire stations and police stations will probably be fully occupied with first aid and rescue activities. Don't call them to ask about the state of a disaster. This will only disturb their activities. </li>
      <li>Too many calls placed just after an earthquake will overwhelm the telephone system. Try to use telephones as little as possible.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Actions to take when evacuating　・When leaving your house</h2>
    <p>Check the house around you when evacuating. Unforeseeable accidents can strike. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Check carefully around you when leaving. There may be falling glass or signboards.</li>
      <li>Turn off the power breaker and close the main gas valve before leaving the house.</li>
      <li>After checking the safety of your own house, call on the neighbors to check up on them. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Actions to take when evacuating　・When a fire breaks out</h2>
    <p>The smoke from fires often kills. Act calmly when leaving the scene of the fire.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Always be prepared for fires. Confirm that your evacuation route is open and usable every day.</li>
      <li>When you hear a fire alarm, try to find out what's going on and take prompt action.</li>
      <li>If a room or corridor fills with smoke, cover your mouth and nose with a handkerchief or towel to avoid inhaling smoke, and evacuate. Try to keep low as you move (smoke rises).</li>

    <h2>Actions to take when evacuating　・Evacuation method</h2>
    <p>If you use a car for evacuation, it may cause chaos.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Evacuate on foot, if possible. If you use a car, you may cause traffic jams and hamper firefighting and rescue activities.</li>
      <li>The roads you usually take by foot may be congested and hard to negotiate. Carry your belongings on your back whenever possible to help you walk easily. Wear comfortable clothes in which you can move freely.</li>
      <li>The elementary or junior high school near you is designated as an evacuation area. If further risk is anticipated, you need to evacuate to a wide-area evacuation site. Find out the nearest evacuation areas and wide-area evacuation sites near your home and workplace.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If you have difficulty returning home　・Wise judgment when planning your trip home</h2>
    <p>If you stubbornly decide to return home over a long distance, your decision may lead to secondary disasters in some cases. Try not to move around without good reason.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chaos and disorder will probably hamper firefighting and other emergency activities. The available roads may be congested or cut off, and people may clamor into the stations. </li>
      <li>If you are concerned about the safety of your family, try to contact them on a public phone or use NTT's Disaster Message Dial (dial #171) or the disaster message board of your mobile phone service. Once you have confirmed their safety, forcible evacuation is not necessary.</li>
      <li>Try not to think only about going home. Also think about participating in the rescue activities where you are now.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If you have difficulty returning home　・Getting home</h2>
    <p>When an earthquake strikes, you may not be able to use the roads that you usually use. Try to walk the route you might take when a disaster strikes. Check the state of the road.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Plan out a good route home, in case you have to return home on foot. Try to avoid routes that may be blocked or where chaos is likely to break out.</li>
      <li>It's dangerous to walk at night because it's difficult to see where you are going. Think carefully about the time of day when planning your return, especially if your house is far away. </li>
      <li>School buildings, public facilities, convenience stores, and gas stations are being increasingly used as support facilities for people who have difficulty getting home. Many will provide information when a disaster occurs. Check those facilities as well.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rescue・First aid　・Putting out fires just after they break out</h2>
    <p>When a strong tremor strikes, secure your safety first and then put out the fire.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The first thing to do when a tremor strikes is to get under a desk or the like to protect yourself. If anything catches on fire, try to kill the flames after the tremors stop.</li>
      <li>If a fire breaks out, call out loudly for help while trying to put the fire out with a nearby fire extinguisher.</li>
      <li>If you can't extinguish the fire early enough and the fire spreads to the ceiling, secure your own safety and the safety of others in the house, then call the fire department. </li>
      <li>When waiting for the arrival of the fire department, check that the neighbors have evacuated (especially people who need help, such as children or the elderly). Work with neighbors and community disaster-relief organizations to prevent the spread of fire by arranging bucket relays, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rescue・First aid　・Evacuation method</h2>
    <p>Cooperation with others nearby is especially important when the fire department can't reach the scene or carry out rescue activities. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Larger disasters injure more people and block off more roads. In some cases, the fire department and other emergency services may not be able to reach a disaster scene in time. When that happens, it's crucial to help those around you by providing first aid for minor injuries.</li>
      <li>If people are buried in collapsed houses or under fallen objects, check whether they are conscious and encourage them to hang on. Rescue activities are often dangerous. The best way to carry them out is in groups, working in cooperation.</li>
    </ul>
